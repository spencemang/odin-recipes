<h3> Description </h3>
     <p>This super tasty lasagna would make Garfield get off his lazy ass and run through a hall of fire. It is so good I left my family. Twice. </p>
<h4> Ingredients </h4>
<ul>
    <li>Meat(italian sausage and lean ground beef)</li>
    <li>Onion and garlic</li>
    <li>Tomato products(1 can crushed tomatoes, 2 cans tomato sauce, 2 cans tomato paste)</li>
    <li>Sugar(two tablespoons)</li>
    <li>Italian Seasoning</li>
    <li>Lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>Cheese(Parmesan,mozzarella, and ricotta)</li>
    <li>Eggs</li>

</ul>
<h4> Steps </h4>
<ol>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, Italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. </li>

    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt. </li>

    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). </li>

    <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese. </li>

    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. </li>
